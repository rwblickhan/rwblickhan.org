> In Connecticut, the Governor's council took one look at the sky and decided to call it quits. Go home and wait for the angelic hosts to roll in. 'Close it up. Lights out.' One of them, however, wasn't having it: 'I am against adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment; if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles may be brought.' The skies are dark. So are our prospects. Let's get back to work anyway. Bring the candles.

- David Moldawer, ["bring the candles"](https://mavengame.com/2020/10/bring-the-candles/), *The Maven Game*

Can't be distracted. We know this much is true,\
And it's true for all souls: each of us will one day\
Find the feast finished and, fattened or famished,\
Step slowly backward into their own dark hall\
For that final night of sleep.

– anonymous (trans. Maria Dahvana Headley), *Beowulf*

> May I try to tell you again where your only comfort lies? It is not in forgetting the happy past. People bring us well-meant but miserable consolations when they tell us what time will do to help our grief. We do not want to lose our grief, because our grief is bound up with our love and we could not cease to mourn without being robbed of our affections.

– Phillips Brooks in a letter to a friend on the death of his mother (h/t [*Futility Closet*]((https://www.futilitycloset.com/2021/04/23/remembering/))

> To his venerable master A., greeting. This is to inform you that I am studying at Oxford with great diligence, but the matter of money stands greatly in the way of my promotion, as it is now two months since I spent the last of what you sent me. The city is expensive and makes many demands. I have to rent lodgings, buy necessaries, and provide for many other things which I cannot now specify. Wherefore I respectfully beg your paternity that by the promptings of divine pity you may assist me, so that I may be able to complete what I have well begun.

– From a circa 1220 form letter provided by Oxford University to students seeking money from patrons (via [*Futility Closet*]((https://www.futilitycloset.com/2021/01/15/student-debt/)))

> He remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty window pane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct.

- ending intertitle of Wong Kar Wai's *In the Mood for Love*

> *The flesh surrenders itself,* he thought. *Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not... yet, I occurred.*

- Frank Herbert, *Dune Messiah*

> Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don’t know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It’s that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don’t know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that’s so deeply a part of your being that you can’t even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.

- Paul Bowles, *The Sheltering Sky* (via [Futility Closet](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2022/04/20/countless/))

> 'My father, that old snake, didn’t pass on the secret. He died without telling me. He took it to the grave. Skinflint scoundrel!' 'You see, it’s turned out very well. Come on, come on. Let’s go together, you and I. You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons. We’ll go to Trinity Monastery together. What a feast day for the people. You’ve brought them such joy, and you’re crying.'

- Andrei Tarkovsky's *Andrei Rublev*

> But what is grief, if not love persevering?

- "Previously On", *WandaVision*

> I don’t expect that anyone will be reading my stuff after I die — I expect that I’ll be wholly forgotten before I die, if I live to a good age — but I almost never think about that. At the end of Middlemarch George Eliot says of Dorothea that “the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts,” and that captures better than I can my convictions on this point. Diffusive is the key word: an influence that subtly spreads, perhaps without anyone noticing. I find that model of influence more encouraging and comforting than any hopes for fame could ever be.

- Alan Jacobs, "DNA", *Snakes and Ladders*
