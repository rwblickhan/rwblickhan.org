# Sesame Grilled Cheese Bagel

## Ingredients

* One sesame seed bagel
* One tbsp of butter
* One block of sharp cheddar (or another cheese, to taste)
* Two Thai red chili peppers
* Two teaspoons of Sichuan peppercorn
* (optional) One turkey slice

## Steps

1. Cut the bagel in half.
2. Slice off a quarter-inch thick block of cheese. Lay it on top of the bottom bagel half.
3. Mince two Thai red chili peppers.
4. Spread the minced Thai red chili peppers and roughly two teaspoons of Sichuan peppercorns on top of the cheese.
5. (optional) Fold the slice of turkey on top of the cheese, pepper, and peppercorn.
6. Put the top half of the bagel on top of the bottom half.
7. Melt one tbsp of butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
8. Once the butter has melted, place the bagel in the middle of the frying pan. Press it using a sandwich press or simply weight it down with another pan.
9. After two or three minutes, or once the cheese starts to melt, flip the bagel with a spatula. Press it again.
10. After another two or three minutes, or once the cheese is fully melted, take the bagel off the frying pan.
11. Cut the bagel lengthwise.
