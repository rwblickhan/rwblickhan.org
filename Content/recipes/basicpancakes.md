# Basic Pancakes

## Ingredients

### Dry

* 0.625 cups white flour
* 1 tbsp powdered sugar
* 1 tsp baking power[^1]
* A pinch of salt
* \~1/4 cup chopped walnuts

### Wet

* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 tbsp butter

## Steps

1. Melt 1 tbsp butter.[^2]
2. Mix the dry ingredients (0.625 cups white flour, 1 tbsp powdered sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, pinch of salt, and \~1/4 cup chopped walnuts) in one bowl.
3. Mix the wet ingredients (1/2 cup milk, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp butter, _in that order_) in another bowl.
4. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet and mix vigorously to form batter.[^3]
5. Heat a non-stick or slightly oiled pan to medium or medium-high heat.
6. Pour \~1/2 cup of batter into the heated pan.
7. Wait until the bottom side of the pancake is lightly browned (usually about a minute).
8. Using a spatula, flip the pancake. Wait until the other side is lightly browned, then use the spatula to take the pancake off the heat. If the heat was high enough, the inside should still be slightly gooey.
9. Repeat until you run out of batter; this will typically yield \~3 pancakes.
10. Top pancakes with a small amount of butter and maple syrup or honey.

[^2]:	I like to use the microwave - 30 seconds usually does the trick.

[^3]:	It generally mixes better if you pour _dry_ into _wet_ specifically.
