# About

Hello there!

I am a programmer by trade, a writer by profession, and a dilettante by inclination. I am, very broadly, interested in **culture** and **systems**.

I'm currently an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/). I studied mathematics and computer science at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in beautiful Vancouver, BC. I did co-op with [T2 Systems](https://www.t2systems.com/), [AWS Thinkbox](https://www.thinkboxsoftware.com/), and [AWS Snowmobile](https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/), and was an active member of [UBC Launch Pad](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com/).

I live in San Francisco with [my girlfriend Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

This is my personal site and all opinions expressed herein are my own.
