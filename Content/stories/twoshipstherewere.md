# Two Ships There Were

Two ships there were  
Atwixt the seas  
Afull of fur  
And Grabbull knees.  

Their captains went  
All whereabouts  
With but a tent  
And twenty scouts.  

They sought their fame.  
They sought their cash.  
They had no shame.  
They lacked a stash.  

And so upon  
The mighty seas  
They went up on  
The island’s knees.  

They hunt and hunt,  
They grab their loot,  
To be quite blunt,  
It was a hoot.  

Then on their way  
Back to their ships,  
They spot a fey  
And lose their grips.  

Each tries to catch  
A prize worth more,  
With one dispatch,  
Than all before.  

They fight and fight,  
They grunt their pains,  
But soon comes night  
With no more gains.  

The fey is gone,  
So they leave too,  
But dwell still on  
What they should do.  

The morning next,  
They pull around,  
With some pretext;  
No backing down.  

One voice shouts out,  
“It’s mine, you fool!  
I’ll not be rout!  
It’s my prize jewel!”  

The other, bent,  
Made do to clash,  
When down he went  
With quite a splash.  

Their crews, they’d wise-  
ly threw o’board  
the two whose lies  
they’d not ignored.  

And then they all,  
Now newly cash’d,  
Made do a call  
To end up smash’d.  

*Fin.*
