## bat

[`bat`][1] is described as a "`cat(1)` clone with wings". `cat` is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often itâ€™s simply used to print a file to the command line. `bat` leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and `git` integration. I have `cat` aliased to `bat`.

## exa

[exa][2] is a modern replacement for `ls`. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than `ls`, I really only use it for one reason: the [pretty colours][3]! I have `ls` aliased to `exa`.
