## Current Projects

### *A Prince of Foxes*

After noodling around with various [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) projects during the pandemic, I'm finally tackling a "real" novel that I hope to publish one day, which I'm tentatively calling *A Prince of Foxes*. It's intended to be [sociological epic fantasy](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) in the vein of *Game of Thrones* or *Dune*. The first draft stands at **66,360 words** out of an estimated 90,000.

###  [Stampy](https://github.com/rwblickhan/Stampy)

I’m experimenting with SwiftUI by building a simple iOS client for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/), my favorite email newsletter service. It’s currently available on TestFlight by invite.

## Newsletter

The best way to keep up with me is to punch in your email below to subscribe to `rwblog`, my (very) erratically released newsletter.

<div class="bg-rwb-slate-light dark:bg-neutral-800 my-4 px-5 pt-4 pb-1.5 max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded">
    <form
      action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/rwblickhan"
      method="post"
      target="popupwindow"
      onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan', 'popupwindow')"
      class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
    >
      <label for="bd-email">Enter your email:</label>
      <input type="email" name="email" class="block mb-4 px-4 py-3 w-full bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900 border border-slate-400 rounded" />
      <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" class="block mb-2 px-4 py-3 w-full text-white bg-rwb-blue-light dark:bg-rwb-blue-dark border-0 rounded cursor-pointer" />
    </form>
</div>

Historical note: I used to call my newsletter [Applied Dilettantery](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan) and organize it into seasons, as recommended by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com). Although I no longer follow that format, here were the seasons for reference:

* [Season 1](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/soma-or-moving-to-san-francisco-and-living-to-tell/) was primarily life updates and reviews of my media diet.
* [Season 2](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/misplaced-institutional-incentives-ad-s2e1/) was short, stream-of-consciousness essays about ideas that grabbed my attention, released biweekly.
* [Season 3](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/the-house-part-i-s3e1/) was a weekly series of short stories.
* [Season 4](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/whats-new-rooby-doo-applied-dilettantery-s4e1/) was a weekly dump of my favorite links of the week and some short essays.

## Other Stuff

* I sometimes put [unpolished short fiction](/stories) up here. Two of my favorites are ["The Bridge"](/stories/thebridge) and ["The Factory"](/stories/thefactory).
* I log the [books](/books) and [films](/films) I read and watch. I try to do 52 of each per year.
* I collect some of my [favorite quotes](/quotes).
* I write up some of my [favorite recipes](/recipes), mostly for my own use.
* I wrote about the [tools I'm using in 2022](/tools/2022).

## About

Professionally, I am an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

This site is generated with the [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) static site generator, using a theme handwritten by me 🙂 It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) as the main font. It's served out of an [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) behind [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/), with the infrastructure managed by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
