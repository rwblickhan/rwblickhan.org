Hello there! I'm a programmer and writer.

## Current Projects

* *A Prince of Foxes*
    - After noodling around with various [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) projects during the pandemic, I'm finally tackling a "real" novel that I hope to publish one day, which I'm tentatively calling *A Prince of Foxes*.
    - It's intended to be [sociological epic fantasy](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) in the vein of *Game of Thrones* or *Dune*.
    - The exploratory rough draft of 29,017 words is **completed**.
    - The initial outline of 2,637 words is **completed**.
    - The first draft is currently **47,046 words** out of an estimated 90,000.
* [Stampy](https://github.com/rwblickhan/Stampy)
    - I’m experimenting with SwiftUI by building a simple iOS client for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/), my favorite email newsletter service.
    - It’s currently available on TestFlight by invite.

## Newsletter

The best way to keep up with me is to punch in your email below to subscribe to `rwblog`, my (very) erratically released newsletter.

      method="post"
      target="popupwindow"
      onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan', 'popupwindow')"

Historical note: I used to call my newsletter [Applied Dilettantery](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan) and organize it into seasons, as recommended by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com). Although I no longer follow that format, here were the seasons for reference:

* [Season 1](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/soma-or-moving-to-san-francisco-and-living-to-tell/) was primarily life updates and reviews of my media diet.
* [Season 2](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/misplaced-institutional-incentives-ad-s2e1/) was short, stream-of-consciousness essays about ideas that grabbed my attention, released biweekly.
* [Season 3](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/the-house-part-i-s3e1/) was a weekly series of short stories.
* [Season 4](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/whats-new-rooby-doo-applied-dilettantery-s4e1/) was a weekly dump of my favorite links of the week and some short essays.

## Other Stuff

* I sometimes put [unpolished short fiction](/stories) up here. Two of my favorites are ["The Bridge"](/stories/thebridge) and ["The Factory"](/stories/thefactory).
* I try to read [52 books](/52books) and watch [52 films](/52films) per year.
* I collect some of my [favorite quotes](/quotes).
* I'm write up some of my [favorite recipes](/recipes), mostly for my own use.
* I wrote about the [tools I'm using in 2022](/tools/2022).

## About

Professionally, I am an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/).

I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.
