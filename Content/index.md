## About

Hello there! I'm a programmer and writer.

I currently work as an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/) and have a degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
I live in San Francisco with [my girlfriend Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

## Current Projects

* [Spreppy](https://github.com/rwblickhan/Spreppy)
    - I'm in the (very) early stages of trying to build an [iOS-assed iOS app](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps) for spaced repetition.
* *A Prince of Foxes*
    - After noodling around with various [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) projects during the pandemic, I'm finally tackling a "real" novel that I hope to publish one day, which I'm tentatively calling *A Prince of Foxes*.
    - It's intended to be [sociological epic fantasy](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) in the vein of *Game of Thrones* or *Dune*.
    - The rough draft is currently **14,991 words** out of an estimated ???.

## Other Stuff

* I sometimes put [unpolished short fiction](/stories) up here. Two of my favorites are ["The Bridge"](/stories/thebridge) and ["The Factory"](/stories/thefactory).
* I try to read [52 books](/52books) and watch [52 films](/52films) per year. I collect some of my [favorite quotes](quotes) from them.

## Newsletter

Once upon a time I wrote a personal newsletter called [Applied Dilettantery](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan):

* [Season 1](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/soma-or-moving-to-san-francisco-and-living-to-tell/) was primarily life updates and reviews of my media diet.
* [Season 2](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/misplaced-institutional-incentives-ad-s2e1/) was short, stream-of-consciousness essays about ideas that grabbed my attention, released biweekly.
* [Season 3](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/the-house-part-i-s3e1/) was a weekly series of short stories.
* [Season 4](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/whats-new-rooby-doo-applied-dilettantery-s4e1/) was a weekly dump of my favorite links of the week and some short essays.

I stopped writing it when I realized it wasn't encouraging me to write any more than I normally did.
In fact, I came to view it as a hassle that got in the way of the "real" writing I wanted to do, not to mention the weekly cadence meant the average quality was quite poor.

I may revive the newsletter in the future, but it will likely look very different.
