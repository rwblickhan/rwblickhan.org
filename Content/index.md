## Newsletter

I write a newsletter called [Applied Dilettantery](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan). [Season 1](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/soma-or-moving-to-san-francisco-and-living-to-tell/) was primarily life updates and reviews of my media diet. [Season 2](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/misplaced-institutional-incentives-ad-s2e1/) was short, stream-of-consciousness essays about ideas that grabbed my attention, released biweekly. [Season 3](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/the-house-part-i-s3e1/) was a weekly series of short stories. [Season 4](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/whats-new-rooby-doo-applied-dilettantery-s4e1/) is a weekly dump of my favorite links of the week, and occasionally short essays when I feel like it. Someday there will be a season 5.
