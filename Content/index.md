## Newsletter

I write a newsletter called [Applied Dilettantery](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan). [Season 1](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/soma-or-moving-to-san-francisco-and-living-to-tell/) was primarily life updates and reviews of my media diet. [Season 2](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/misplaced-institutional-incentives-ad-s2e1/) was short, stream-of-consciousness essays about ideas that grabbed my attention, released biweekly. [Season 3](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/the-house-part-i-s3e1/) is a weekly series of short stories. Someday there will be a season 4.
